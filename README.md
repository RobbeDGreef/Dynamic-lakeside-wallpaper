# Dynamic lakeside

Simple dynamic lakeside wallpaper for gnome

The art and a template for the .xml files were
taken from an old commit of [this](https://github.com/b1izzard-34/Dynamic-gnome-wallpapers "Original gnome wallpaper repo") github repo
unfortunately the lakeside art was taken out of the repo so you'll have to look in the early commits to find it.

The original art is found [here](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/wallpaper/jculsb683ok "Original lakeside art")

I created a simple installer and changed the timing in the xml files.
