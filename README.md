Simple dynamic lakeside wallpaper for gnome

The art and a template for the .xml files were
taken from an old commit of [this](https://github.com/b1izzard-34/Dynamic-gnome-wallpapers "Original gnome wallpaper repo") github repository.
Unfortunately the lakeside art was taken out of the repo so you'll have to look in the early commits if you want to find it.

The original art is found [here](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/wallpaper/jculsb683ok "Original lakeside art")
All the credit goes out to the original artist (Louis Coyle) for his amazing drawings.

I created a simple installer and changed the timing in the xml files.
Simply clone the repository and run `./install` and the installer will install the wallpaper.
